## Brown's Bio

Devin enjoys spending his free time hacking interesting problems and challenging
his physical limitations by scaling over-sized mountains. This goes without saying,
he has an innate love for coffee. From start to finish, he loves methodologically
crafting the perfect Caf√© crema or an lazy Sunday afternoon cold press.
