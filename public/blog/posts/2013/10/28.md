# Craft Coffee

There's a lot of buzz surround the idea of "craft coffee" these days. Gourmet this, and gourmet that, beans roasted and imported from around the world, and beans roasted in your very own backyard. Coffee is a rich and vibrant industry, that's often overshadowed by the ominous mega-chain manufactures of the world that produce ton after ton of the same boring old brew. Their coffee is not only uninteresting, it's inconvenient to purchase. We plan to change things here at [Grndz](http://www.grndz.com).

Here at [Grndz](http://www.grndz.com) we believe with all of our heart that the coffee browsing and buying experience should be just as enjoyable as the very coffee that you drink. There should be a intuitive, elegant marketplace that gives the user a streamlined experience for sorting through the immense quantity of coffee, quickly and effectively.

There are two primary elements at play here, first, the need to create a *high quality online marketplace* for craft coffee producers and consumers alike. Second, there needs to be a  high quality mechanism for delivering this coffee, on a regular basis if desired. Coffee should compared, contrasted, reviewed, then delivered directly to your doorstep.

[Grndz](http://www.grndz.com) is all about changing the game. We're here to shake the beans up and do our best to revolutionize the coffee industry as we know it. We want to encourage local roasters to flourish, much like the the resurgence in the craft beer industry. Our goal is to facilitate the means in which truly unique (and delicious) coffee can be bought and delivered. 

We're just starting, so hang tight. We've managed to get this blogging site up and running to keep the world posted, and to keep ourselves accountable. In the meantime, checkout our [primary Grndz site](http://www.grndz.com) for additional info!
