<p>Coffee may be one of the most widely available substances in the world, yet still there is a growing gap between your corner coffee shop and local grocer. We believe with all our hearts that there should be a great way to enjoy a high quality cup of espresso, latte or simple joe from the comfort of your own home. This isn't just about taking out the middle man of coffee procurement, because in all regards, what we're really talking about here is cutting out the inconvenience of find high quality grounds on a regular basis. We're talking about expanding the local craft coffee marketplace, increasing the diversity of beans, roasts and grounds - all from the comfort of you're own home.</p>
