# Product Outline

## Overview

The importance of establishing a marketplace rich with interesting, diverse and desired coffee is of the greatest importance to the success of this business. The coffee must not only be tasty and of high quality, but it must be packaged and marketed to appeal to the masses. Much like the *craft brew industry*, which has thrived in recent years, we must make the aesthetic of the product appealing in more ways then just quality alone.
