# Business Goals

>The most important reason for being in business for myself is:

**BYOB (Be Your own Boss)**

Granted that there's far more work involved when you're the boss, it would still be an optimal goal for me to become my own boss. You get to make the calls when you run shop, ultimately you guide the future and success of the company.

**Interesting Content**

More than anything, I want to work on something I'm passionate about. Creating a product and a business that has a worthwhile and personally relevant mission to me. Filing TPS reports or doing what "the higher ups" have planned, isn't really my cup of tea. I want to create something truly worthwhile, something that has value to me AND the customers.

**Flexibility**

A big reason for wanting to be in the business of business, is the ability to create an infrastructure of effort that gives me the ability to work whenever, from wherever, when I want. Building a business will consume a great deal of effort, but ultimately I'd like to be able to travel and work on other projects more frequently.

**Challenge**

There's the grand allure of building a business and a product that harps down to a primordial essence in me. The idea of taking something from nothing, and turning it into an object of value, respect and pride is *very appealing* to me. I want to BUILD THINGS, and I want to be able to push myself further than any employer could ever do!
