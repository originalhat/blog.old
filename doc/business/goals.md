# Business Goals

>The most important reason for being in business for myself is:

**BYOB (Be Your own Boss)**

Granted that there's far more work involved when you're the boss, it would still be an optimal goal for me to become my own boss. You get to make the calls when you run shop, ultimately you guide the future and success of the company.

**Interesting Content**

More than anything, I want to work on something I'm passionate about. Creating a product and a business that has a worthwhile and personally relevant mission to me. Filing TPS reports or doing what "the higher ups" have planned, isn't really my cup of tea. I want to create something truly worthwhile, something that has value to me AND the customers.

**Flexibility**

A big reason for wanting to be in the business of business, is the ability to create an infrastructure of effort that gives me the ability to work whenever, from wherever, when I want. Building a business will consume a great deal of effort, but ultimately I'd like to be able to travel and work on other projects more frequently.

**Challenge**

There's the grand allure of building a business and a product that harps down to a primordial essence in me. The idea of taking something from nothing, and turning it into an object of value, respect and pride is *very appealing* to me. I want to BUILD THINGS, and I want to be able to push myself further than any employer could ever do!

>Within **six months** I would like the business to be:

Within six months (mid-march 2014), I would like to see serious development efforts underway to get the primary product, Grounds âœ˜ Grounds, up and running. Estimating where the process will be at, specifically, will be tough to estimate. Ultimately however, the legal, business, and planning stages will be well behind us, clearing the path for heavy duty technical development.

>Within **one year** I would like the business to be:

At the very least, it would be good to see the product nearing a completed state, a point of reaching a MVP. The aspects of business, legal and planning will be quite distant, and the process of adding polish to the product will be in full swing. Ideally, we could ship, but we're not only in the process of finishing the technical side of things, but beginning to showcase and engage with the B2B side of things to get our inventory "stocked."

>Within **two year** I would like the business to be:

By the fall of 2015 we should begin to see sales increasing and our product line diversifying. There will continue to be technical enhancements and additional features being added to the core product. This stage of the business will predominately be about gaining new customers, spreading virally, saturating the marketplace, marketing, adding products to our lineup and adding additional "polish" to the core product.

>Within **five years** I would like the business to be:

At this point, I'd like to see more of the last "two years" - enhance the core product, building the inventory, gaining more customers, etc. If things are progressing well, it would be a great time to consider expanding to additional cities, looking for extra funding sources, and bringing on new talent.

>Within **ten years** I would like the business to be:

This is the point where we're filthy rich, and only work Fridays. The business is on autopilot and is managed by some MBA right out of Harvard. Who give's a fuck, we could die rich. Probably a good place to start working on building another business.

>When I look back over the past "five" years of my career I feel:

Frustrated with the lack of competence, drive and innovation in a field ripe for producing interesting and worthwhile products. Mediocrity is a the bane of my existence, and is a mortal sin of progress. On a lighter note, I'm very happy with the knowledge I've managed to accumulate thus far, it will give a significant advantage to the development of this product.

A large majority of my career in the last "five" years was in school, which is benign in comparison to the experiences and knowledge accumulated in the "real world." Despite these great opportunities to "do well for myself," I still leave work at the end of the day knowing there's a greater potential waiting to be tapped. Playing the games of politics and ass kissing for a mediocre product only can go so far before you realize that there are more interesting projects out there to work on.

All around, I feel like my working experiences have been positive, and I'd like to continue to engage in them, but I do feel as if there is something more challenging and interesting to be accomplished.

>I fell the next thing I must do about my business is:

Get a comprehensive plan together with detailed strategies and technical implementation details sorted out and formalized.

>The most important part of my business (or will be):

Innovation. The company should be autonomous, and stay out the hands of third parties as much as possible. Relinquishing or slowly losing control is not something I would particularly enjoy. Obviously a successful business will be comprised of a well planned and executed business strategy, a brilliant product, and a strong consumer base. This success is really the most important thing to me, as without it there is no longevity of the business.

>The area of my business I really excel in is:

1. Organization
2. Time Management
3. Technical Skills (building the product)
4. Big / Little Picture
5. Details

>The area of my business I don't really excel in is:

1. Legal Strategy / Knowledge
2. Business Planning (e.g. market research)
3. B2B Logistics / Contracting
