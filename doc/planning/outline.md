# Grounds & Grounds

A virtual marketplace

## Product Vision

Coffee is a rich and vibrant experience. It's something you can enjoy from your own home - it should also be something you can order from your home. Gone are the days of getting your bland, uninteresting coffee from the local supermarket. Here are the days where you can easily order high quality, gourmet coffee from local roasters, right to your front door.

We put the buzz back in coffee by adding an exciting, interesting, and relatable experience when buying coffee. Similar to craft breweries, coffee can enjoy it's explosive return to the marketplace by providing the customer with a place to browse and purchase richly unique blends of roasted coffee blends.

## Product Need

The biggest single determining factor in a product's success, whether it be virtual or physical, is **convenience**. When a consumer makes a choice, it's typically a choice that's made out of convenience. Grounds & Grounds introduces much needed innovation to the coffee marketplace by adding selection, quality and most importantly convenience.

Finding coffee, particularly high quality, niche products in a given city isn't unobtainable - but it is however a major inconvenience. Hopping from coffee shop to coffee shop to find deals on interesting blends / roasts of coffee is time consuming and often isn't worth the effort. Creating an electronic marketplace, instantly opens a gateway to a huge pre-existing consumer base  that's, literally THIRSTY for innovation.

The need for the product is in the lack of innovation in not just the coffee market, but the food related consumer marketplace. Coffee happens to be a good fit for the "craftification" of coffee.
