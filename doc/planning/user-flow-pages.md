# Grounds & Grounds

## User Flow

The standard flow for all users will involve **(1)** viewing the product catalog, which grants them total access to see all *Grounds & Grounds* products. A user may then **(2)** click on a product to gain access to additional information. If a customer wishes to purchase this product, and *is not logged in*, they may either **(3a)** register then be redirected to checkout, or **(3b)** or login and be redirected to checkout. If the user is already logged in, they may **(3c)** proceed directly to the checkout.

## Primary Pages

### Product Catalog

The **Product Catalog** gives the user a marketplace in which to view the products we plan on offering (primarily coffee grounds, obviously). Envisioned to be a storefront, similar in nature to something like Steam, where promotional items can be pushed higher in the "stack" and other interesting subcategories can be viewed easily.

NOTE: This is probably the most important page, and will house the largest part of functionality. Nailing the right layout and UX flow for this page will be a huge determining factor in this projects success.

### Product Information

The **Product Information** page(s) will be ancillary content for individual products, providing detailed information on each product either through an independent page, a modal, slide up, or some other delivery mechanism.

This is an extension for the Product Catalog, but allows for easy integration, modularity, and a clutter free Product Catalog by extracting this functionality into an independent component.
