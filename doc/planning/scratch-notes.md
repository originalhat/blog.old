# Scratch Notes

## Overview

Why waste the digestible and worthwhile biomass that typically ends up in landfills - especially when it could be turned into something rich, vibrant, and full of life! Retired apple cores, hole ridden shoes, filtered coffee grounds, and old newspapers can be recycled into something useful once more.

Rather than letting these high organically rich products go to waste, why not collect them from city dwellers in efficient compact containers to be composted into high quality, premium grade grounds…of dirt! This compostable biomass can be shuttled via hipsters on scooters and delivered to a central composting center where the dirt is then organized and managed into an efficient composting center, which yields premium dirt.

This dirt can then be sold back to the very people, or alternative vendors who provided the used organic matter as premium grade dirt.

The second part of the equation is a system for delivering high grade coffee beans to the very people who originally provided the compostable materials. As the compostable material is picked up, the coffee could be delivered.

Composting is a gateway into the homes and pocketbooks of *urban consumers,* of which have an unquenchable thirst for *urban sustainability* and niche coffee markets. The delivery network, powered by hipsters on scooters provides a fun and vibrant medium for the consumer to ingest our product.

The medium for engaging customers could be through a mobile native mobile application which allows for pickup, delivery, and account management.

## Fiscal Feasibility

There are still a number of unknowns, particularly with regard to he **best** path to maximized profitability.

**TBA:**

- subscription service (reoccurring)?
- costs for coffee / dirt delivery
- cost or payment for getting grounds
- discounts for providing compostable material
- logistical complexities for delivery
- logistical complexities for composting process

## Technical Services

e.g. the app, webpage, etc.

## Physical Services

e.g. the compost center, employees, physical locations, etc.

## Other Misc. Thoughts

Is delivering dirt a good / worthwhile idea?

How can we map the idea of taking their compostable material, and turning it into something fresh and useful?

Scalability issues - how can we make this product expand itself with minimal managerial input?

- contract hire
- allow the couriers to be "free agents"
- pay based on the # of delivers / quality?
- have total control over the system (leaning towards this)

Collection to dirt system…we get a "container a week", they get a bag every `n` months (a systematic approach for the in and out flow of what they provide and what we give them in return).

If they don't want the dirt, we can *possibly* pay them for what it's worth?

People in the city might want to dive into composting, but run into the physical limitations of small living spaces, no backyard, lack of time, etc. WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

There are really two business ideas here. Getting them to work together is key, but I'm not sure I've found the optimal path.

### DENVER GROUNDS

We make a $MART business move by becoming the gateway, middleman, or "steam store" of the coffee market. This entails working with local coffee roasters & importers to market their products to our customer base (note from above: we've established a solid customer base by dealing with their compost).

We could have a "monthly catalog" (delivered to your phone tablet or email), where you can view and order interesting new blends.

It's a smart move to deliver coffee because it's a stable product with little to no legal ramifications. There's room for lots of markup, high diversity, and a significant potential marketplace.

This boutique / gourmet coffee business could be segwayed into other products that hold true to the "sustainable mindset." (What other goods might *urban consumers* be interested in?brown
)

## Thoughts: Day 2

I've revised my ideas after the day following initial inception. Composting is a difficult sell, although I feel like there's still something worthwhile to be extracted from the concepts of "Grounds & Grounds." It may make more sense to put an emphasis on the coffee delivery / consumption business and a de-emphasized (yet still relevant) emphasis on the acceptance of compostable matter.

The idea of deliverable coffee has a strong selling point, particularly with regard to the "urban consumer" and the chic nature of the product. Gathering a consumers used coffee grounds has a worthwhile ascetic to it, gives the consumer a sense of purpose, introduces us to them in a marketplace, and allows us to distribute a organically rich product to local composters.

Cavet: do we lose something special when we disassociate the concept of "Grounds & Grounds" too much? There's business potential there.

The "process":

1. Local Gourmet Coffee
2. Order via "The App"
3. Delivered via Scootsters
4. Get Old Grounds
5. Recycle Grounds Back into the Ground.
